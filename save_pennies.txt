Penny pincher (A guide to saving pennies)

Well, you may be wondering how you can save your pennies 
when building. The secret is props!

Props are very undervalued. You can use one command for 
just about every command in that room (not exits however) 
with the prop function. Simply make one command and set 
second or even third names, for example:

    +hi;cow;moo;wave;eat

We can take those command and use 
    {prop:commands/{&cmd},{&cmd}}. 

What this will do is use the prop for that command, 
the prop would be stored on the same action. Now insted 
of setting an @succ for each command, set one
    @succ "{prop:commands/{&cmd},{&cmd}}" 

and @set what you want the @succ for that action like so:

    @set <command>=commands/<command SUCC you wish to set>:<the succ message for that command>

Now you know how to cut back on that. Next, and lastly, 
I will cover Rooms.

They are not exactly very useful in many situations, but they 
can be used in some. Simply use the if function to check where
you should be according to a prop.

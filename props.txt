~listen/XXX	How to set value: *Say/pose-text-here*=&Action-text-here
This will trigger the action text on the current player (success type) when they say or pose the text between the *s. You need a W-bit or ask a wizard to set this since it has a ~.
~olisten/XXX	How to set value: *Say/pose-text-here*=&Action-text-here
This will trigger the action text on all other players (o-success type) when they say or pose the text between the *s. You need a W-bit or ask a wizard to set this since it has a ~.
Some props are not the same on most mucks (ie. _sleep is usualy where it keeps the command for where to move sleepers to) so they have been excluded.

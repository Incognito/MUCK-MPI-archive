This entire project is really just a way to preserve some personal history  
of when I programmed MPI code around the year 2000, when I was 12 years old.

It's unlikely to be of any real use to you, but starting in 2002 through 2005
I ran the highest ranked website on google for MPI, and that was something
I was very proud of at the time, even with my very limited knowledge of 
software. Big fish in a small pond. Wasn't the smartest fish, just a big one.

The code MPI was based on MUCKS.

The perticular MUCK server I was programming this for was on the now seemingly 
defunt MUCK project, NMC.

Most of the work I did is lost somewhere to archive.org, on free hosting websites
or the limitless.org domain somewhere.

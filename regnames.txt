Tips to regnames

Well in this guide there is not much to cover, however I felt it 
would be useful to make a page on it.

If you are creating a series of rooms you can always, insted of setting 
regular reg names, make directories. For example, in my MPI Hack Me 
Challange I used _reg/H/ as a dir for my room reg names, level one 
would be stored as _reg/h/1 and level two as _reg/h/2 and the others
would folow that order. You can easily jump from room to room with 
'jump $h/1' if you wanted to jump to level one for example. Well thats
about it and I hope you learnt somthing.
